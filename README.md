# Blogmas

In the spirit of Vlogmas, I participated in Blogmas â€” miniposts every day of December 2020 until Christmas. I wrote about something I learned / coded that day.

This is the semi-interactive calendar visualizer to showcase my work. The megapost can be found [here](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/blogmas-2020).
